# Project-Manager-App
This project is a collaborative event platform built in pairs using Node.js, Express.js, and TailwindCSS. It allows users to view events, add new ones, and vote for those they like. The app is based on a REST API and stores data in a database. The project was completed in two days and deployed online with a demo video.
